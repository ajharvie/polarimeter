Design files for custom parts for the polarimeter, including:

1) .stl format files for the flow cell and mounting block
2) .stl format file for the 3d printed part for mounting the optical sensors onto an optical post
3) .brd and .sch files for a PCB to interface with the OPT101s (use of 8-pin DIP sockets recommended)
4) .stl format file for the 3d printed part for mounting the microcontroller
5) .brd and .sch files for a PCB for connections to the ÂµC (and power passthrough)
6) A technical drawing of the flow cell dimensions
