"Demo_Figure.m" contains matlab code to generate Fig 2. Requires the function sdft_plug.m to work.

"Simulator.m" is the code used to simulate polarimeter behaviour in the supporting info. It works over 1000000 samples so takes a long time to run!

Polarimeter_Signals.ino is arduino code which outputs the measured and corrected optical signals recorded by the photodiodes, and scaled by the reference signal recorded by the light-frequency converter.
