Arduino firmware for the polarimeter. Two versions are presented:
1) TeensyPolarimeterv1_0 is the version used to obtain the data in the paper. It is written for a deprecated version of teensyduino and should not be used.
2) TeensyPolarimeterv1_1 is compatible with the current version (1.51) of teensyduino. It will work on a Teensy 3.6 or Teensy 4.0.

Requires Arduino and the Teensyduino add-on (current version 1.51) to use.
