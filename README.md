*A High-Performance Polarimeter Formed from Inexpensive Optical Parts*

Firmware for polarimeter described in upcoming publication. Code for the microcontroller can be found in the "Arduino Code" folder. The folder "Frontend tool" provides a simple python GUI for interfacing with the polarimeter. 
"Design files" contains .stl format files for custom parts used to build the polarimeter, as well as .brd files for circuit boards.
"Supporting Files" contains code for recording optical signals and simulating polarimeter behaviour, as well as data files for the plots presented in the paper.
