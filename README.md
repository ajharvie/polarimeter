Firmware and supporting data for a polarimeter as described in Scientific Reports: **A high-resolution polarimeter formed from inexpensive optical parts** https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-61715-7

Code for the microcontroller can be found in the "Arduino Code" folder. The folder "Frontend tool" provides a simple python GUI for interfacing with the polarimeter. 
"Design files" contains .stl format files for custom parts used to build the polarimeter, as well as .brd files for circuit boards.
"Supporting Files" contains code for recording optical signals and simulating polarimeter behaviour, as well as data files for the plots presented in the paper.

**A new version is in development - you can find the design files here: https://github.com/OpenPolarimeter/OPol with a publication and build guide forthcoming**
